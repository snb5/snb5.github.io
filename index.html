					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>
						My name is Shannon Brown. My birthday is August 12th. I am 20 years old. I go to the University of South Carolina. I am a biology major. I am in clubs such as CHAARG, Give a dog a bone, Women in healthcare, etc. 
						My favorite color is pink. I was born in Virginia. I went to elementary school in Maryland. I went to middle and high school in Pennsylvania. 
						I have two dogs. They are rescues. Their names are Goose and Cooper. I have a sister who is 5 and a half years younger than me.
					</p>
					<p id="pA2" class="hidden">
						I recently started enjoying doing at home workout as a hobby. Dance workouts are very fun and keep me engaged and entertained. Pilates workouts are also fun.
						I like to watch Youtube and Netflix when I have free time. Dexter is one of my favorite TV shows I watched on Netflix. 
						During the week I spend almost all of my day focusing on school work, so on the weekends I like to get my mind off of school. One way I relax on the weekends is by going out with my friends.
						My friends and I like to hang out and watch movies together. I'm very grateful for the friends I have.

					<h2>My Future Career Plans</h2>
					<p>
						Right now, I am a sophomore undergraduate Biology major with a Pre-Medicine concentration. When I graduate, I want to move on to medical school. Right now, I'm looking into schools like UVA, Pennstate, and Johns Hopkins for medical school.
						Since I plan on going to medical school, it is pretty clear that I want to become a physician. I'm not totally sure what kind of doctor I want to be yet. My main interests are family medicine and plastic surgery.
						I am interested in family medicine because it is the specialty I am most familiar with because that is the type of doctor I most often interact with/go see. I find plastic surgery very interesting and it is the specialty I enjoy learning about the most.
						However, I have heard that getting into plastic surgery is very difficult.
					</p>
					<p id="pF2" class="hidden">
						If I do not matriculate into medical school, I have some back-up plans. One of my back-up plans is to become a high school science teacher. Over winter break I shadowed my former high school biology teacher to get a feel for what her job is like.
						While being a doctor is still my primary goal, I think being a teacher could be interesting too. If I decided to become a teacher, I could get my master's in education after I get my undergraduate degree. Another back-up career I have in mind is a career in research.
						I already do undergraduate research and I like it well enough. However, it is not what I envision myself doing for the rest of my life, so this may just be a temporary career if I go this route.
